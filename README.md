# NLP Projects

This exists a space for my projects pretaining to Natural Language Processing. First project will be the comparision of the first episode of the show 'The Simpsons' to the first episode of the show 'South Park'. These projects will be a way to be introduced to the current landscape of Natural Language packages for the python language and to play with interesting datasets of my own making.
